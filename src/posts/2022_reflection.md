# What Did I Do This Year?

As 2022 winds down, I've found myself looking back and wondering: what did I do that matters to me? In many ways, it was a blur. Being a founding member of a seed-stage startup will do that to you, not to mention moving to a new state and all that involves.

And so, while I haven't historically publicized my accomplishments like this, this year I figure I'll try it. More than anything, I hope it will serve to inspire me to achieve my goals for 2023, some of which I'll also post below.

### Personal Accomplishments (Unordered)
  💰 This year, I successfully paid off my private student loans by paying down the remaining $53k I had left. While I still have a chunk remaining in the form of public student loan debt, this has been a deeply engrained goal of mine since I graduated college. Stay tuned for this one, I have more to say.
  🌅 In March of this year, we visited San Diego. A week after, I quit my job. 2 weeks after that we packed our thing and made the 3 day drive to San Diego to start a new life. I haven't regretted it once (though I do miss my family).
  👰‍♀️ Despite the pandemic, and my own concerns, I was able to attend my sister and now brother-in-law's wedding in Puerto Rico. It was a wonderful occasion and I'm grateful I was there to see it.
  💻 This year I joined as a founding hire for a new startup (technically Dec 2021). It may have been a risk financially. But it has paid of emotionally and experentially. I love my colleagues and Workheli. I believe in each of them, and I believe in what we're building.
  📊 NormConf. This year I was able to co-organize, speak-at, and attend [NormConf](https://normconf.com/). NormConf was a labor of love. There have been many takes. Perhaps I'll say something more about it one day. But I think Vicki's take has said what needed to be said. ❤️
  Among my conributions (it was a <i>team</i> effort) were:
  - organizing the conference
  - tracking and forecasting the financials
  - organizing the surprise appearence of the International String Band
  - design the community guidelines and moderation policy
  - deploying the conference API
  - coordinating with NumFOCUS to help raise $16k dollars!

  🏫 Despite all the busyness of this year, I stuck to my goal of continuing my math education by taking a DiffEq course at UCSD. I learned a bunch.
  🖥️ After monitoring prices for some time and slowly accumulating the parts, I built a PC for the first time this break. I love it and I'm already using my NVIDIA GPU.
  🏃‍♂️ I don't talk about it much, but a decade ago I started running and have rarely stopped since. I continued my pattern of running (or biking) almost every day (this year was a little less running than I'm use to. Going to change that next year.
  👨‍💻 This year I launched new version of my website. I'm relatively happy with it (though it could use some improvements). I'd been meaning to do it for a while and I'm happy I did.
  📋 I wrote 3 posts this year (this one counts!). I love writing. I intend to do more in the coming year.
  ⛺️ In 2021 I hiked Sequoia for the first time with my close friends. Unfortunately, my partner Hannah was unable to attend. This always bothered me. Thankfully, she surprised me with a National Park pass and a planned trip to Sequoia for my birthday. It was a highlight and I'm grateful we got to go.

### What do I want to accomplish next year?
  💸 My goal has always been to pay off all my student loans by the time I am 30. As 2023 will be that year (September), I intend to meet or exceed that goal.
  👩‍💼 My sister is going to be starting a business this year and I have committed to helping her get started. I'm excited for her, I'm confident in her business accumen, and I'm looking forward to the successes we'll have.
  👨‍🏫 I have already signed up for another math class at UCSD. I hope to take at least one additional credited course this year.
  📟 I'd like to contribute to at least one popular OSS package this year.
  🏞️ I'd like to visit at least two national parks this year and camp at least twice.
  🗒️ I aim to write at least 5 posts this year.
  👫 I'm going to look into joining a running club in San Diego this year.
  🗺️ I hope to travel to at least two countries this year.
  📄 I'd like to write an economic research article for a journal based on the work we're doing at Workhelix.
  📓 Speaking of journals, I'd like to read more—especially foundational journal articles.


We'll see what 2023 brings. Happy new year!
